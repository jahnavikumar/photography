<br> <div> DISCLAIMER - now i know some of you might not like the pictures i clicked and that's okay , be my worst critique for all i care. <br>
i don't consider myself a photographer in any way, nor am i doing it for anyother purpose other than having fun. <br>
this is only to record or rather store my progress as a beginner <br>
ENOUGH OF RANTING SORRY <br> </div>
